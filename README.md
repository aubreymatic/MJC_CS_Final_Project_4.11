# MJC_CS_Final_Project_4.11
Note that I have deleted my repo to stop being billed for LFS data packs. I have saved the entire repo, and I will back it up for when it's later needed.
I will be putting back my projects files, but the original history of pushes will not be here. The original copy still has the push history.

My VR game project created with Unreal Engine 4.11 but I will create a seperate 4.12 version when released. OSVR suport will be implemented into 4.12, so I don't need to add the plugin myself. I removed the OSVR plugin from the repo, since it was missing a lot of required files. I also acidently deleted my project from my computer, so getting the project to work requires creating a whole new project in Unreal Engine. Then copy over the content folder, and recreate the C++ files and VRPlayer character, in the Unreal Engine editor, from the original code in the source folder in the repository.
